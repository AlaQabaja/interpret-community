# Supported Models

This API supports models that are trained on datasets in Python `numpy.array`, `pandas.DataFrame`, `iml.datatypes.DenseData`, or `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` format.


The explanation functions accept both models and pipelines as input, as long as the model or pipeline implements the prediction function predict or predict_proba that conforms to the Scikit convention. If not compatible, you can wrap your model's prediction function into a wrapper function that transforms the output into the format that is supported (predict or predict_proba of Scikit), and pass that wrapper function to your selected interpretability techniques.  

If a pipeline script is provided, the explanation function assumes that the running pipeline script returns a prediction. The repository also supports models trained via **PyTorch**, **TensorFlow**, and **Keras** deep learning frameworks.


# Supported Explainers

[//]: #  (Mehrnoosh todo: this section requires rewording )

[//]: #  (Add ref to
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azureml-explain-model/azureml.explain.model?view=azure-ml-py)


The following are a list of the experimental explainers available in the community repository:
Interpretability Technique|Description|Type
|--|--|--------------------|
|SHAP Kernel Explainer| [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)'s Kernel explainer uses a specially weighted local linear regression to estimate SHAP values for **any model**.|Model-agnostic|
|SHAP Tree Explainer| [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)â€™s tree explainer, which focuses on polynomial time fast SHAP value estimation algorithm specific to **trees and ensembles of trees**.|Model-specific|
|SHAP Deep Explainer| Based on the explanation from [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap), Deep Explainer "is a high-speed approximation algorithm for SHAP values in deep learning models that builds on a connection with DeepLIFT described in the [SHAP NIPS paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/7062-a-unified-approach-to-interpreting-model-predictions). **TensorFlow** models and **Keras** models using the TensorFlow backend are supported (there is also preliminary support for PyTorch)".|Model-specific|
|SHAP Linear Explainer| [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)'s Linear explainer computes SHAP values for a **linear model**, optionally accounting for inter-feature correlations.|Model-specific|
|Mimic Explainer (Global Surrogate)| Mimic explainer is based on the idea of training [global surrogate models](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/global.html) to mimic blackbox models. A global surrogate model is an intrinsically interpretable model that is trained to approximate the predictions of **any black box model** as accurately as possible. Data scientists can interpret the surrogate model to draw conclusions about the black box model. You can use one of the following interpretable models as your surrogate model: LightGBM (LGBMExplainableModel), Linear Regression (LinearExplainableModel), Stochastic Gradient Descent explainable model (SGDExplainableModel), and Decision Tree (DecisionTreeExplainableModel).|Model-agnostic|
|Permutation Feature Importance Explainer (PFI)| Permutation Feature Importance is a technique used to explain classification and regression models that is inspired by [Breiman's Random Forests paper](https://www.stat.berkeley.edu/~breiman/randomforest2001.pdf) (see section 10). At a high level, the way it works is by randomly shuffling data one feature at a time for the entire dataset and calculating how much the performance metric of interest changes. The larger the change, the more important that feature is. PFI can explain the overall behavior of **any underlying model** but does not explain individual predictions. |Model-agnostic|




Besides the interpretability techniques described above, Interpret-Community supports another [SHAP-based explainer](https://github.com/slundberg/shap), called `TabularExplainer`. Depending on the model, `TabularExplainer` uses one of the supported SHAP explainers:


  | Original Model   | Invoked Explainer  |
  |-----|-----|
  | Tree-based models | SHAP TreeExplainer|
  | Deep Neural Network models| SHAP DeepExplainer|
  | Linear models | SHAP LinearExplainer |
  | None of the above  | SHAP KernelExplainer |

# Use Interpret-Community


## Interpretability in training


1. Train your model


    ```python
    # load breast cancer dataset, a well-known small dataset that comes with scikit-learn
    from sklearn.datasets import load_breast_cancer
    from sklearn import svm
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    breast_cancer_data = load_breast_cancer()
    classes = breast_cancer_data.target_names.tolist()
    
    # split data into train and test
    from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
    x_train, x_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(breast_cancer_data.data,            
                                                        breast_cancer_data.target,  
                                                        test_size=0.2,
                                                        random_state=0)
    clf = svm.SVC(gamma=0.001, C=100., probability=True)
    model = clf.fit(x_train, y_train)
    ```

2. Call the explainer: To initialize an explainer object, you need to pass your model and someÂ training dataÂ to the explainer's constructor. You can also optionally pass in feature names and output class names (if doing classification) which will be used to make your explanations and visualizations more informative. Here is how to instantiate an explainer object using `TabularExplainer`, `MimicExplainer`, or `PFIExplainer` locally. `TabularExplainer` calls one of the four SHAP explainers underneath (`TreeExplainer`, `DeepExplainer`, `LinearExplainer`, or `KernelExplainer`), and automatically selects the most appropriate one for your use case. You can however, call each of its four underlying explainers directly.

    ```python
    from interpret.ext.blackbox import TabularExplainer

    # "features" and "classes" fields are optional
    explainer = TabularExplainer(model, 
                                 x_train, 
                                 features=breast_cancer_data.feature_names, 
                                 classes=classes)
    ```

    or

    ```python

    from interpret.ext.blackbox import MimicExplainer
    
    # you can use one of the following four interpretable models as a global surrogate to the black box model
    
    from interpret.ext.glassbox import LGBMExplainableModel
    from interpret.ext.glassbox import LinearExplainableModel
    from interpret.ext.glassbox import SGDExplainableModel
    from interpret.ext.glassbox import DecisionTreeExplainableModel

    # "features" and "classes" fields are optional
    # augment_data is optional and if true, oversamples the initialization examples to improve surrogate model accuracy to fit original model.  Useful for high-dimensional data where the number of rows is less than the number of columns. 
    # max_num_of_augmentations is optional and defines max number of times we can increase the input data size.
    # LGBMExplainableModel can be replaced with LinearExplainableModel, SGDExplainableModel, or DecisionTreeExplainableModel
    explainer = MimicExplainer(model, 
                               x_train, 
                               LGBMExplainableModel, 
                               augment_data=True, 
                               max_num_of_augmentations=10, 
                               features=breast_cancer_data.feature_names, 
                               classes=classes)
    ```
   or

    ```python
    from interpret.ext.blackbox import PFIExplainer 
    
    # "features" and "classes" fields are optional
    explainer = PFIExplainer(model, 
                             features=breast_cancer_data.feature_names, 
                             classes=classes)
    ```



The following two sections demonstrate how you can get global and local feature importance values. Local measures focus on the contribution of features for a specific prediction (e.g., why the model predicted an 80% chance of breast cancer for Mary?), whereas global measures take all predictions into account (Overall, what are the top K important features in predicting a high risk for breast cancer?):
## Overall (Global) feature importance values

Get the aggregate feature importance values.
    
```python

# you can use the training data or the test data here
global_explanation = explainer.explain_global(x_train)

# if you used the PFIExplainer in the previous step, use the next line of code instead
# global_explanation = explainer.explain_global(x_train, true_labels=y_test)

# sorted feature importance values and feature names
sorted_global_importance_values = global_explanation.get_ranked_global_values()
sorted_global_importance_names = global_explanation.get_ranked_global_names()


# alternatively, you can print out a dictionary that holds the top K feature names and values
global_explanation.get_feature_importance_dict()
```

## Instance-level (local) feature importance values
Get the local feature importance values: use the following function calls to explain an individual instance or a group of instances. Please note that PFIExplainer does not support local explanations.

```python
# explain the first data point in the test set
local_explanation = explainer.explain_local(x_test[0])

# sorted feature importance values and feature names
sorted_local_importance_names = local_explanation.get_ranked_local_names()
sorted_local_importance_values = local_explanation.get_ranked_local_values()
```

or

```python
# explain the first five data points in the test set
local_explanation = explainer.explain_local(x_test[0:5])

# sorted feature importance values and feature names
sorted_local_importance_names = local_explanation.get_ranked_local_names()
sorted_local_importance_values = local_explanation.get_ranked_local_values()
```


## Raw feature transformations

Optionally, you can pass your feature transformation pipeline to the explainer to receive explanations in terms of the raw features before the transformation (rather than engineered features). If you skip this, the explainer provides explanations in terms of engineered features.


The format of supported transformations is same as the one described in [sklearn-pandas](https://github.com/scikit-learn-contrib/sklearn-pandas). In general, any transformations are supported as long as they operate on a single column and are therefore clearly one to many. 

We can explain raw features by either using a `sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer` or a list of fitted transformer tuples. The cell below uses `sklearn.compose.ColumnTransformer`. 

```python
from sklearn.compose import ColumnTransformer

numeric_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='median')),
    ('scaler', StandardScaler())])

categorical_transformer = Pipeline(steps=[
    ('imputer', SimpleImputer(strategy='constant', fill_value='missing')),
    ('onehot', OneHotEncoder(handle_unknown='ignore'))])

preprocessor = ColumnTransformer(
    transformers=[
        ('num', numeric_transformer, numeric_features),
        ('cat', categorical_transformer, categorical_features)])

# append classifier to preprocessing pipeline.
# now we have a full prediction pipeline.
clf = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', preprocessor),
                      ('classifier', LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs'))])


# append classifier to preprocessing pipeline.
# now we have a full prediction pipeline.
clf = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', preprocessor),
                      ('classifier', LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs'))])


# clf.steps[-1][1] returns the trained classification model
# pass transformation as an input to create the explanation object
# "features" and "classes" fields are optional
tabular_explainer = TabularExplainer(clf.steps[-1][1],
                                     initialization_examples=x_train,
                                     features=dataset_feature_names,
                                     classes=dataset_classes,
                                     transformations=preprocessor)
```

In case you want to run the example with the list of fitted transformer tuples, use the following code: 
```python
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler, OneHotEncoder
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn_pandas import DataFrameMapper

# assume that we have created two arrays, numerical and categorical, which holds the numerical and categorical feature names

numeric_transformations = [([f], Pipeline(steps=[('imputer', SimpleImputer(
    strategy='median')), ('scaler', StandardScaler())])) for f in numerical]

categorical_transformations = [([f], OneHotEncoder(
    handle_unknown='ignore', sparse=False)) for f in categorical]

transformations = numeric_transformations + categorical_transformations

# append model to preprocessing pipeline.
# now we have a full prediction pipeline.
clf = Pipeline(steps=[('preprocessor', DataFrameMapper(transformations)),
                      ('classifier', LogisticRegression(solver='lbfgs'))])

# clf.steps[-1][1] returns the trained classification model
# pass transformation as an input to create the explanation object
# "features" and "classes" fields are optional
tabular_explainer = TabularExplainer(clf.steps[-1][1],
                                     initialization_examples=x_train,
                                     features=dataset_feature_names,
                                     classes=dataset_classes,
                                     transformations=transformations)
```
